## Description
This is my second website just to learn website design and coding and my first one using JS. It is not connected or affiliated with any other websites or people. This website has many different features like music, countdown timer, clock, task and progress bar, motivational quotes, and notes space. Here is the link to the website: https://saanvi4800.github.io/Focus-Dashboard/

## Navigating the website
This website is pretty simple, with only one page displaying several cards that each house a different feature. For example the center one has a clock, and the top left has a tasks list. Also it does stretch out weird on larger screens so to see it how it was originally made try minimizing the window slightly. If you cannot do that it still is fine, the cards may just look slightly small for the screen.

## Technologies Used
HTML<br>
CSS<br>
JS<br>

## How I made this project
I created this project to further my website coding and development as well as design and I really learned a lot. I also wanted to begin javaScript coding and this project gave me an oppurtunity to do just that. I also liked the idea of customizing it to me because I know that there are many projects just like mine. That gave me the oppurtunity to create it so I could use it in my everyday life. I also created this website to submit for the athena awards program. I did struggle a lot with this project although it seems like a simple website, I was not quite familiar with all of the syntax and honestly being new to js made it that much harder, although I did eventually figure it out. If I had to redo this project there would certainly be parts where I could move along faster and understand better now. It was quite frusterating getting the code to do what I wanted and constantly moving back and forth to see if what I changed worked. All in all however I genuinely believe that I got a lot out of this project in terms of knowledge and I 100% will be using this project myself.
